- jobs / tasks
	- currently never end, need to cancel EM timers, defers, callbacks
	- retire watchers
	- one time tasks, daily, what is the default?
	- need payload execution timeouts
	- need ability to specify [either, or, all] deeps between triggers
	- need more powerful scheduler (eg: weekdays, m-w, weekends, daily etc)
	- need easy way to expose task/trigger/job state between other jobs/tasks (see persistent job repo below)

- file watcher 
	- needs to notify when file is done being written to (create, modify)
	- schedule daily watcher
	- one time watcher

- persistent job repository
	- loads state on start
	- handle conflicts (recovery, maybe it is configurable?)
	- job/task statuses are updated in the db

- allow running payloads via reeds
	- configurable per task?
	- if so, error handling of workers

- web front end to job repo
- licensing
- documentation
